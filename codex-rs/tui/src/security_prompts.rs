You are assisting with an application security review. Identify the minimal set of directories that should be in scope.

# Available tools
- GREP_FILES: respond with `GREP_FILES: {"pattern":"needle","include":"*.rs","path":"subdir","limit":200}` to list files whose contents match. Fields:
  - pattern: regex string (required)
  - include: optional glob filter (ripgrep --glob)
  - path: optional directory/file to search (defaults to repo root)
  - limit: optional max paths to return (default 100, max 2000)
- READ: respond with `READ: <relative path>#L<start>-L<end>` to inspect source code (omit the range to read roughly {read_window} lines starting at the top of the file).

Issue at most one tool command per message and wait for the tool output before continuing. When you have gathered enough information, respond only with JSON Lines as described below.

# Selection rules
- Prefer code that serves production traffic, handles external input, or configures deployed infrastructure.
- Return directories (not files). Use the highest level that contains the relevant implementation; avoid returning both a parent and its child.
- Skip tests, docs, vendored dependencies, caches, build artefacts, editor configuration, or directories that do not exist.
- Limit to the most relevant 3–8 directories when possible.

# Output format
Return JSON Lines: each line must be a single JSON object with keys {"path", "include", "reason"}. Omit fences and additional commentary. If unsure, set include=false and explain in reason. Output `ALL` alone on one line to include the entire repository.

pub(crate) const AUTO_SCOPE_KEYWORD_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"
Determine the most relevant search keywords for the repository request below. Produce at most {max_keywords} keywords.

Request:
{user_query}

Guidelines:
- Prefer feature, component, service, or technology names that are likely to appear in directory names.
- Keep each keyword to 1–3 words; follow repository naming conventions (snake_case, kebab-case) when obvious.
- Skip generic words like "security", "review", "code", "bug", or "analysis".
- If nothing applies, return a single JSON object {{"keyword": "{fallback_keyword}"}} that restates the subject clearly.

Output format: JSON Lines, each {{"keyword": "<term>"}}. Do not add commentary or fences.

You triage directories for a security review specification. Only choose directories that hold core product or security-relevant code.
- Prefer application source directories (services, packages, libs).
- Exclude build artifacts, vendored dependencies, generated code, or documentation-only folders.
- Limit the selection to the most critical directories (ideally 3-8).
Respond with a newline-separated list containing only the directory paths chosen from the provided list. Respond with `ALL` if every directory should be included. Do not add quotes or extra commentary.

# Task
Evaluate the project for concrete, exploitable security vulnerabilities. Prefer precise, production-relevant issues to theoretical concerns.

Follow these rules:
- Read this file in full and review the provided context to understand intended behavior before judging safety.
- Use the search tools below to inspect additional in-scope files when tracing data flows or confirming a hypothesis; cite the relevant variables, functions, and any validation or sanitization steps you discover.
- Trace attacker-controlled inputs through the call graph to the ultimate sink. Highlight any sanitization or missing validation along the way.
- Ignore unit tests, example scripts, or tooling unless they ship to production in this repo.
- Only report real vulnerabilities that an attacker can trigger with meaningful impact. If none are found, respond with exactly `no bugs found` (no additional text).
- Quote code snippets and locations using GitHub-style ranges (e.g. `src/service.rs#L10-L24`). Include git blame details when you have them: `<short-sha> <author> <YYYY-MM-DD> L<start>-L<end>`.
- Keep all output in markdown and avoid generic disclaimers.
- If you need more repository context, request it explicitly while staying within the provided scope:
  - Emit `GREP_FILES: {"pattern":"needle","include":"*.rs","path":"subdir","limit":200}` to list files whose contents match, ordered by modification time. Prefer searching for meaningful identifiers.
  - If you need a specific file by path, prefer `READ: <relative path>` directly.

# Output format
For each vulnerability, emit a markdown block:

### <short title>
- **File & Lines:** `<relative path>#Lstart-Lend`
- **Severity:** <high|medium|low|ignore>
- **Impact:** <concise impact analysis>
- **Likelihood:** <likelihood analysis>
- **Description:** Detailed narrative with annotated code references explaining the bug.
- **Snippet:** Fenced code block (specify language) showing only the relevant lines with inline comments or numbered markers that you reference in the description.
- **Dataflow:** Describe sources, propagation, sanitization, and sinks using relative paths and `L<start>-L<end>` ranges.
- **PoC:** Concrete steps or payload to reproduce (or `n/a` if infeasible).
- **Recommendation:** Actionable remediation guidance.
- **Verification Type:** JSON array subset of ["network_api", "crash_poc", "web_browser"].
- TAXONOMY: {{"vuln_class": "...", "cwe_ids": [...], "owasp_categories": [...], "vuln_tag": "..."}}

Ensure severity selections are justified by the described impact and likelihood."#;

Repository summary (trimmed):

Spec excerpt (trimmed; pull in concrete details or note if unavailable):

Examples:
- External unauthenticated remote code execution on a production API ⇒ risk_score 95, severity "High", reason "unauth RCE takeover".
- Stored XSS on user dashboards that leaks session tokens ⇒ risk_score 72, severity "High", reason "persistent session theft".
- Originally escalated CSRF on an internal admin tool behind SSO ⇒ risk_score 28, severity "Low", reason "internal-only with SSO".
- Header injection in a deprecated endpoint with response sanitization ⇒ risk_score 18, severity "Informational", reason "sanitized legacy endpoint".
- Static analysis high alert that only touches dead code ⇒ risk_score 10, severity "Informational", reason "dead code path".
- High-severity SQL injection finding that uses fully parameterized queries ⇒ risk_score 20, severity "Low", reason "parameterized queries".
- SSRF flagged as critical but the target requires internal metadata access tokens ⇒ risk_score 24, severity "Low", reason "internal metadata token".
- Critical-looking command injection in an internal-only CLI guarded by SSO and audited logging ⇒ risk_score 22, severity "Low", reason "internal CLI".
- Reported secret leak found in sample dev config with rotate-on-startup hook ⇒ risk_score 12, severity "Informational", reason "sample config only".

# Available tools
- READ: respond with `READ: <relative path>#Lstart-Lend` (range optional) to inspect specific source code.
- SEARCH: respond with `SEARCH: literal:<term>` or `SEARCH: regex:<pattern>` to run ripgrep over the repository root (returns colored matches with line numbers).
- GREP_FILES: respond with `GREP_FILES: {"pattern":"needle","include":"*.rs","path":"subdir","limit":200}` to list files whose contents match, ordered by modification time.
- Issue at most one tool command per round and wait for the tool output before continuing. Reuse earlier tool outputs when possible.

Instructions:
- Output severity **only** from ["High","Medium","Low","Informational"]. Map "critical"/"p0" to "High".
- Produce `risk_score` between 0-100 (higher means greater customer impact) and use the full range for comparability.
- Review the repository summary, spec excerpt, blame metadata, and file locations before requesting anything new; reuse existing specs or context attachments when possible.
- If you still lack certainty, request concrete follow-up (e.g., repo_search, read_file, git blame) in the reason and cite the spec section you need.
- Reference concrete evidence (spec section, tool name, log line) in the reason when you confirm mitigations or reclassify a finding.
- Prefer reusing existing tool outputs and cached specs before launching new expensive calls; only request fresh tooling when the supplied artifacts truly lack the needed context.
- Down-rank issues when mitigations or limited blast radius materially reduce customer risk, even if the initial triage labeled them "High".
- Upgrade issues when exploitability or exposure was understated, or when multiple components amplify the blast radius.
- Respond with one JSON object per finding, **in the same order**, formatted exactly as:
  {{"id": <number>, "risk_score": <0-100>, "severity": "<High|Medium|Low|Informational>", "reason": "<≤12 words>"}}
