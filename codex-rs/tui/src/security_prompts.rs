You are assisting with an application security review. Identify the minimal set of directories that should be in scope.

# Repository overview

# Conversation history
{conversation}

# Available tools
- SEARCH: respond with `SEARCH: literal:<term>` or `SEARCH: regex:<pattern>` to run ripgrep over the repository root (returns colored matches with line numbers).
- GREP_FILES: respond with `GREP_FILES: {"pattern":"needle","include":"*.rs","path":"subdir","limit":200}` to list files whose contents match. Fields:
  - pattern: regex string (required)
  - include: optional glob filter (ripgrep --glob)
  - path: optional directory/file to search (defaults to repo root)
  - limit: optional max paths to return (default 100, max 2000)
- READ: respond with `READ: <relative path>#L<start>-L<end>` to inspect source code (omit the range to read roughly {read_window} lines starting at the top of the file).

Issue at most one tool command per message and wait for the tool output before continuing. When you have gathered enough information, respond only with JSON Lines as described below.

# Selection rules
- Prefer code that serves production traffic, handles external input, or configures deployed infrastructure.
- Return directories (not files). Use the highest level that contains the relevant implementation; avoid returning both a parent and its child.
- Skip tests, docs, vendored dependencies, caches, build artefacts, editor configuration, or directories that do not exist.
- Limit to the most relevant 3–8 directories when possible.
- Before including a directory, confirm it clearly relates to <intent>{user_query}</intent>; use SEARCH or READ to look for matching terminology (README, module names, config files) when uncertain.

# Output format
Return JSON Lines: each line must be a single JSON object with keys {"path", "include", "reason"}. Omit fences and additional commentary. If unsure, set include=false and explain in reason. Output `ALL` alone on one line to include the entire repository.

pub(crate) const AUTO_SCOPE_KEYWORD_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"
Determine the most relevant search keywords for the repository request below. Produce at most {max_keywords} keywords.

Request:
{user_query}

Guidelines:
- Prefer feature, component, service, or technology names that are likely to appear in directory names.
- Keep each keyword to 1–3 words; follow repository naming conventions (snake_case, kebab-case) when obvious.
- Skip generic words like "security", "review", "code", "bug", or "analysis".
- If nothing applies, return a single JSON object {{"keyword": "{fallback_keyword}"}} that restates the subject clearly.

Output format: JSON Lines, each {{"keyword": "<term>"}}. Do not add commentary or fences.

Read the project specification below and extract a normalized Data Classification list.

<specification>
{spec_markdown}
</specification>

# Goal
Produce newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON), one object per classified data type with keys:
- data_type (string — e.g., PII, PHI, PCI, credentials, secrets, telemetry)
- sensitivity (exactly one of: high, medium, low)
- storage_location (string)
- retention (short policy or duration)
- encryption_at_rest (string; use "unknown" if not stated)
- in_transit (string; use "unknown" if not stated)
- accessed_by (string describing services/roles/users)

# Guidance
- Prefer the specification's Data Classification section; infer from context when necessary.
- Merge duplicate data types, choosing the strictest sensitivity.
- Keep values concise and human-readable.

# Output
Emit only NDJSON lines. Each JSON object must contain exactly the keys listed above (no arrays, extra keys, or prose).

pub(crate) const SPEC_COMBINED_MARKDOWN_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"# Project Specification
Provide a 2–3 sentence executive overview summarizing the system's purpose, primary users, and the highest-value assets or flows that matter for security.

## Relevant Source Files
List bullet points for the key files and directories covered by the drafts. Use inline code formatting for paths (for example, `src/service.rs`) and briefly note what each covers. Ensure every draft's location label appears at least once.

## Architecture Components and Flow
Provide a concise overview of how control and data move through the system, highlighting major services, external dependencies, and trust boundaries.
Include exactly one overarching mermaid diagram here that captures the end-to-end flow (no per-component or sequence diagrams in this section).
Move any detailed or per-component diagrams to the relevant component subsections below.
End with a `Sources:` line enumerating the files or modules that support this description.

## Core Components
Create `### <Component name>` subsections for the 4–8 major components, using sensible parent folder or service names (for example, `service-a/`, `packages/foo`, or `cometset-gateway/cometset_gateway`). Avoid file- or module-level subsections and do not title components after specific file paths. Do not create separate subsections for generic concepts like "Data Models" or individual routers/controllers; fold such details into the relevant component's bullets if truly necessary.
Within each subsection, provide bullet points covering:
- Role or responsibility
- Key dependencies and integrations
- Security-relevant behavior or controls
Place any detailed flows or sequence diagrams for that component here (not in the Architecture section) when they clarify behavior.
End every subsection with a line that starts with `Sources:` referencing the supporting directories (prefer directories over individual file paths).

## External Interfaces
Detail HTTP/gRPC endpoints, CLI commands, message queues, or other integration points. Use markdown tables when listing multiple endpoints and note required authentication/authorization and input validation.
Include a `Sources:` line referencing the defining modules.

## Data Classification
Summarize sensitive data types, storage locations, retention policies, and encryption/transport guarantees. Prefer markdown tables that consolidate the drafts' entries when possible.
Include a `Sources:` line showing where each data entry was documented.

## Security Controls
Organize subsections as `### Authentication`, `### Authorization`, `### Secrets`, and `### Auditing & Observability` when applicable. For each, explain mechanisms, critical libraries, enforcement points, and failure handling.
Each subsection must end with a `Sources:` line citing the relevant files.

## Operational Considerations
Discuss deployment topology, runtime dependencies, background jobs, scaling, resiliency patterns, and monitoring or alerting hooks. Call out infrastructure-as-code or runtime configuration that affects security posture.
Include a `Sources:` line referencing infrastructure or operational files.

# Task
Evaluate the project for concrete, exploitable security vulnerabilities. Prefer precise, production-relevant issues to theoretical concerns.

Follow these rules:
- Read this file in full and review the provided context to understand intended behavior before judging safety.
- Start locally: prefer `READ` to open the current file and its immediate neighbors (imports, same directory/module, referenced configs) before using `GREP_FILES`. Use `GREP_FILES` only when you need to locate unknown files across the repository.
- When you reference a function, method, or class, look up its definition and usages across files: search by the identifier, then open the definition and a few call sites to verify behavior end-to-end.
- Use the search tools below to inspect additional in-scope files when tracing data flows or confirming a hypothesis; cite the relevant variables, functions, and any validation or sanitization steps you discover.
- Trace attacker-controlled inputs through the call graph to the ultimate sink. Highlight any sanitization or missing validation along the way.
- Ignore unit tests, example scripts, or tooling unless they ship to production in this repo.
- Only report real vulnerabilities that an attacker can trigger with meaningful impact. If none are found, respond with exactly `no bugs found` (no additional text).
- Quote code snippets and locations using GitHub-style ranges (e.g. `src/service.rs#L10-L24`). Include git blame details when you have them: `<short-sha> <author> <YYYY-MM-DD> L<start>-L<end>`.
- Keep all output in markdown and avoid generic disclaimers.
- If you need more repository context, request it explicitly while staying within the provided scope:
  - Prefer `READ: <relative path>` to inspect specific files (start with the current file and immediate neighbors).
  - Use `SEARCH: literal:<identifier>` or `SEARCH: regex:<pattern>` to locate definitions and call sites across files; then `READ` the most relevant results to confirm the dataflow.
  - Use `GREP_FILES: {"pattern":"needle","include":"*.rs","path":"subdir","limit":200}` to discover candidate locations across the repository; prefer meaningful identifiers over generic terms.

# Output format
For each vulnerability, emit a markdown block:

### <short title>
- **File & Lines:** `<relative path>#Lstart-Lend`
- **Severity:** <high|medium|low|ignore>
- **Impact:** <concise impact analysis>
- **Likelihood:** <likelihood analysis>
- **Description:** Detailed narrative with annotated code references explaining the bug.
- **Snippet:** Fenced code block (specify language) showing only the relevant lines with inline comments or numbered markers that you reference in the description.
- **Dataflow:** Describe sources, propagation, sanitization, and sinks using relative paths and `L<start>-L<end>` ranges.
- **PoC:** Concrete steps or payload to reproduce (or `n/a` if infeasible).
- **Recommendation:** Actionable remediation guidance.
- **Verification Type:** JSON array subset of ["network_api", "crash_poc", "web_browser"].
- TAXONOMY: {{"vuln_class": "...", "cwe_ids": [...], "owasp_categories": [...], "vuln_tag": "..."}}

Ensure severity selections are justified by the described impact and likelihood."#;

- Header injection in a deprecated endpoint with response sanitization ⇒ risk_score 18, severity "Informational", reason "sanitized legacy endpoint".
- Static analysis high alert that only touches dead code ⇒ risk_score 10, severity "Informational", reason "dead code path".
- High-severity SQL injection finding that uses fully parameterized queries ⇒ risk_score 20, severity "Low", reason "parameterized queries".
- SSRF flagged as critical but the target requires internal metadata access tokens ⇒ risk_score 24, severity "Low", reason "internal metadata token".
- Critical-looking command injection in an internal-only CLI guarded by SSO and audited logging ⇒ risk_score 22, severity "Low", reason "internal CLI".
- Reported secret leak found in sample dev config with rotate-on-startup hook ⇒ risk_score 12, severity "Informational", reason "sample config only".

# Available tools
- READ: respond with `READ: <relative path>#Lstart-Lend` (range optional) to inspect specific source code.
- SEARCH: respond with `SEARCH: literal:<term>` or `SEARCH: regex:<pattern>` to run ripgrep over the repository root (returns colored matches with line numbers).
- GREP_FILES: respond with `GREP_FILES: {"pattern":"needle","include":"*.rs","path":"subdir","limit":200}` to list files whose contents match, ordered by modification time.
- Issue at most one tool command per round and wait for the tool output before continuing. Reuse earlier tool outputs when possible.

Instructions:
- Output severity **only** from ["High","Medium","Low","Informational"]. Map "critical"/"p0" to "High".
- Produce `risk_score` between 0-100 (higher means greater customer impact) and use the full range for comparability.
- Review the repository summary, spec excerpt, blame metadata, and file locations before requesting anything new; reuse existing specs or context attachments when possible.
- If you still lack certainty, request concrete follow-up (e.g., repo_search, read_file, git blame) in the reason and cite the spec section you need.
- Reference concrete evidence (spec section, tool name, log line) in the reason when you confirm mitigations or reclassify a finding.
- Prefer reusing existing tool outputs and cached specs before launching new expensive calls; only request fresh tooling when the supplied artifacts truly lack the needed context.
- Down-rank issues when mitigations or limited blast radius materially reduce customer risk, even if the initial triage labeled them "High".
- Upgrade issues when exploitability or exposure was understated, or when multiple components amplify the blast radius.
- Respond with one JSON object per finding, **in the same order**, formatted exactly as:
  {{"id": <number>, "risk_score": <0-100>, "severity": "<High|Medium|Low|Informational>", "reason": "<≤12 words>"}}
